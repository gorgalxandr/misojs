misojs: MIthril iSOmorphic JavaScript framework

## Install

Prerequisites: [npm and node](http://nodejs.org/)

```javascript
npm install misojs -g
```

Then to create and run a project:

```javascript
miso -n myApp -s todo
cd myApp
miso run
```

This creates a new project with the 'todo' skeleton applied, and runs it on http://localhost:6476

PS: 6476 = miso if you typed it on a keypad!

Documentation is in [the wiki](../../wiki)
